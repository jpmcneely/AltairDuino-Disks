The MITS disk and hard disk images in this directory were created by Mike Douglas 
of altairclone.com. Some can be found in the support/downloads area of the
altair clone web site, others come from the Mike's personal web site at deramp.com

The Tarbell disk images in this directory were taken from Udo Munk's collection
of disk images (z80pack) at: https://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack


More info about the hard disk images in this directory:
The images are sector-by-sector representations of the data on the hard disks,
in the order in which Martin Eberhard's ADEXER tool's XD command would send them:
  cylinder 0 head 0 sector 0..24
  cylinder 0 head 1 sector 0..24
  cylinder 1 head 0 sector 0..24
  cylinder 1 head 1 sector 0..24
  ...
  cylinder 405 head 0 sector 0..24
  cylinder 405 head 1 sector 0..24
